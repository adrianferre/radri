# Filters

**@radri/filters** is a package to handle global filters locally in your app by providing the following advantages:

1. It's fast to apply and propagate the changes since de SSO is a JS object, very useful when you want to store search text, coordinates, scree X Y positions, etc.
2. Automatically updates the URL so the users can share it and use the params as initial values, very usefull for filters applied in Tables and Dashboards.
3. Keep them in sync with the Local Storage so the users can load previous filters when navigating to a different page and share same filters in different pages.
4. Persist in Local Storage and URL are done by using a debounce, so you don't loose animation frames when the filters change too fast.
5. All the persist behaviour is exposed trhu configuration so you can easily change and addapt to different part of your application.
